                    <h4>M.S.Dhoni :</h4>
                    <p> Mahendra singh dhoni (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar (Jharkhand)
                        state, India) Indian cricketer whose rise to prominence in the early
                        21st century culminated in his captaincy of the Indian national team
                        that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in 2011. Dhoni made his
                        international debut in 2004. <br />
                        Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat
                        came to the fore in an innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his
                        fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test
                        team, where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or more
                        runs in a single innings) against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience,
                        Dhoni took over the captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led
                        India to the Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia
                        and Sri Lanka, among others, moved India to the top of the
                        International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first time
                        in December 2009. Dhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day
                        International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009. In the 2011
                        one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings of 91 not out—in front of a
                        home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory over Sri Lanka
                        in the final. He also led India to an appearance in the semifinals of
                        the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain
                        in 2017, having led his country in 331 international matches, the most
                        for a captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired
                        from international competition. <br />
                        Dhoni’s life was the subject of the hit Bollywood film M.S. Dhoni: The
                        Untold Story (2016).</p>
